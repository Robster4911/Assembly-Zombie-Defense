# Assembly-Zombie-Defense
**Authors:** Robert Heine & Divyansh Gupta

##### Compiling and Running
This program was compiled and run using the Irvine assembly library for Visual Studio 2019. 
Go to this link and follow the instructions for setting up a 32-bit assembly project: 
http://www.asmirvine.com/gettingStartedVS2019/index.htm

Then, download Survive.asm from the repository and move it into the Visual Studio project, 
then compile and run through Visual Studio.

##### Controls/Gameplay
The player can move up or down between the lanes by pressing the A and D keys respectively. 
The gun will fire automatically, so the player needs only worry about movement controls.
The game ends when either the player kills all the zombies, or a zombie reaches the left 
hand side of the screen.
