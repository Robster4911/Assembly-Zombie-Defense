# Assembly-Zombie-Defense
**Authors:** Robert Heine & Divyansh Gupta

### Compiling and Running
This program was compiled and run using the Irvine assembly library for Visual Studio 2019. 
Go to this link and follow the instructions for setting up a 32-bit assembly project: 
http://www.asmirvine.com/gettingStartedVS2019/index.htm

Then, download Survive.asm from the repository and move it into the Visual Studio project, 
then compile and run through Visual Studio.

### Controls/Gameplay
The player can move up or down between the lanes by pressing the A and D keys respectively. 
The gun will fire automatically, so the player needs only worry about movement controls.
The game ends when either the player kills all the zombies, or a zombie reaches the left 
hand side of the screen.

### Known Bugs
There was one bug that continuously arose which involved the fence below the play area. 
As the game goes on, this fence slowly begins to disappear, and the cause of this is 
unknown. With the time given to us to complete this project, we were unable to find a fix
for this bug. It does not affect any of the game's mechanics, however it does make the 
game slightly less visually appealing.
